# Adding References from Pubmed

If you do most of your source discovery in Pubmed, you have multiple options for easily adding references to your CiteDrive project. We recommend using the CiteDrive Companion browser extension but additional methods without the extension are also covered in detail below.

> ### Recommendation: Install CiteDrive Companion browser extension
>
> We strongly recommend installing the CiteDrive Companion browser extension for the best experience. Add articles, websites and more directly from Google Scholar, Pubmed and anywhere you're searching. CiteDrive Companion is available from:
> * [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/citedrive-companion/gmmonfphegngpcbcapfbgembkjeookik)
> * [Firefox/Mozilla addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/af/firefox/addon/citedrive-companion/)

## Example: Adding article using CiteDrive Companion

Let's start by looking up our favorite `algorithms` article on Pubmed:

Click on the `Comparing different supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction` paper link to open the full view. Locate the CiteDrive Companion extension icon in the upper right of your browser (highlighted). _If you do not see the icon, please open your browser extensions list and pin the CiteDrive Companion extension in order for the icon to display_

Click the icon and you will see a BibTeX representation of your reference presented, with the ability to customize the BibTeX snippet to your liking:

Once you are satisfied, click `Save Reference` to add the reference to the selected project.
