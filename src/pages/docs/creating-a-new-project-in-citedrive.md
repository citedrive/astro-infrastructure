# Create a project
First, log in to your account to create a new project in CiteDrive. Then, on the dashboard, you can choose between Overleaf, BibTeX/BibLaTeX, and R-Markdown, depending on the environment you want to work with.

You will be prompted to name your project and select a project type. For this example, we will name our project "Example Project" and select "Overleaf."

Once you have created your project, you can invite your team to collaborate on the project and manage your bibliography together. You can also sync your project with Overleaf or R Studio.
