# Literature management with Overleaf

Complete your research pipeline with the powerful two-app. Link your two APPs and get all the updates in your BibTeX file without having to do anything at all manually in Overleaf â€” with a few simple mouse clicks. Concentrate on your work in Overleaf and leave the tedious bibliography and citation formatting to us.

## A quick video tutorial on CiteDrive

## Ideal for Overleaf
Overleaf enables teams of students and researchers to write papers simultaneously, from anywhere, in an easy-to-use, collaborative online LaTeX editor. Overleaf supports a variety of packages, including BibTeX, where you can manage your references. When you connect Overleaf to CiteDrive, you can automatically synchronize your project and BibTeX-database with Overleaf. With CiteDrive, easily collaborate on a project across global reach. When you discover a paper you want to use, use our browser extension, add it to your project with one click. You or anyone on your team can organize, cluster, annotate, and evaluate your material in a concise dashboard. Write faster at Overleaf: Insert in-text citations generated with CiteDrive. Since CiteDrive natively supports BibTeX, all changes are then automatically synced at Overleaf. You no longer need to upload and change references manually.

## Native BibTeX support
We have designed our infrastructure for a BibTeX compliant delivery. We support all official entry and field types, which can be easily entered or imported with one click using our browser plugin: no tedious usage of converters or manual handling. Your project is always kept up to date for Overleaf and in a fashion that LaTeX will support.

## Collect and organize
Notably, with a bigger team working on a single project, copy-pasting or manually entering data to BibTeX databases (.bib-file) can cause much confusion, and mistakes can quickly occur. With CiteDrive, you can easily add references with one click thanks to the browser extension and group the references orderly simply by dragging and dropping.

## Fully collaborative
We know how essential teamwork is for scientists. Comprehensive tools for teams have become commonplace, and most importantly, papers are rarely written alone. We have therefore built our platform for collaboration. Add colleagues to your project at any time. You and your team collect, structure, and annotate references and material for your work, clearly organized in one project.

## Device-agnostic
We conceptualized CiteDrive from the beginning as a form factor and device-agnostic platform for a seamless experience on all devices. Your on-the-go experience reviewing a paper your colleague presently saved should feel just as natural as CiteDrive on the desktop.

## Simple but powerful!
CiteDrive aspires to be an actually easy-to-use, collaborative, and expandable tool for citing, managing references, creating bibliographies, and more.
