# CodeMirror 6: A New Source Editor for Overleaf



Good news, Overleaf users! After several weeks of beta testing, the new source editor (CodeMirror 6) is now available to power Overleaf. This new editor is more modern and supports a wide range of features that the old one did not. Be sure to read Overleaf's [latest update](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/towards-the-future-a-new-source-editor) in their blog!

## Does CiteDrive support the new editor?

CiteDrive is a BibTeX-based platform designed to make referencing and bibliography management easy. With CiteDrive, you can organize your references and team collaboration in projects, sync everything seamlessly to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/citedrive-easy-reference-management-for-overleaf) or [RStudio](https://www.citedrive.com/quarto/), and much more. The CiteDrive Companion is an extension available to [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/citedrive-companion/gmmonfphegngpcbcapfbgembkjeookik), [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/citedrive-bibtex-compan/kpmepfpbjehnlgfbcnbmgihklkkmfnpo), and [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/af/firefox/addon/citedrive-companion/), which allows you to manage your CiteDrive projects without having to switch any window or tab in your browser and has been optimized for the new source editor. While in [the beta phase](https://www.citedrive.com/blog/overleaf-source-editor-upgrade/), we have ensured that optimization works for both the new and old versions of the editor. **So, yes! CiteDrive is fully compatible with the new editor.**

## What about Grammarly?



[Grammarly](https://www.citedrive.com/blog/grammarly-works-with-overleafs-latest-source-editor-upgrade/) is an AI-powered writing assistant that will help you to write mistake-free in any text editor. **Now, Grammarly also works with Overleaf's new source editor!** The integration is seamless and allows you to get spelling and grammar suggestions from Grammarly as you type in the code editor, ensuring your essay is error-free.



## What are some other benefits of the new code editor?

CodeMirror 6 has become an industry standard for code-based editors, used by some of the most popular editor applications. _CiteDrive users edit their BibTeX entries using the same framework._ Compared to its predecessor, it will bring improvements and better behavior on mobile devices (tablets, phones), improved code highlighting and error control, more robust behavior while writing in non-Latin languages, and many more features.


With the new source editor, we hope that you can now enjoy a better writing experience with Overleaf!
