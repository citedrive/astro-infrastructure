# Announcing CiteDrive 3.0: keep track of your bibliographies, references, and citations on Overleaf and RStudio



CiteDrive 3.0 is out now, and it's better than ever! We've made many improvements, including a better design, more focus on reference management with BibTeX, and better performance. If you're an Overleaf or RStudio user, be sure to check it out.



## Better Bib[La]TeX Overleaf workflow

CiteDrive has better integration with Overleaf and BibLaTeX support. It's quick and easy to keep your references well organized, but unlike other modern reference management software, we don't consider BibTeX an afterthought. References can be added and edited with our BibTeX editor, which offers freedom in terms of fields and types. We are here for you whether you use BibTeX, BibLaTex, jurabib, or JBibTEX. 



## New user interface and dark mode

The next update significantly enhances the user experience based on our users' comments and numerous drafts and prototypes we have been developing for months. Make sure to check out dark mode, too!



## Reference, bibliography, and citation management in RStudio (Posit) in Quarto and R Markdown. 

RStudio joins the party and is also compatible with the 3.0 update–adding BibTeX-first referencing to Quarto and R Markdown.

CiteDrive allows you to store your references in a different location from your Quarto/R Markdown process. With our RStudio integration, you may wholly and instantly automatically update the status of your bibliography with the Quarto/R Markdown project at any moment - just as with Overleaf.
