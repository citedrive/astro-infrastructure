# Data Visualization Packages for R you should check out in 2022

In the following, we have listed exciting libraries in R for data visualization that you should check out.

## [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

As part of the robust **tidiyverse** ecosystem, **ggplot2** offers the most feature-rich and versatile graph creation package based on the **grammar of graphics** framework. This principle divides graphs into components such as datasets, scales, levels, etc. The user combines these components to describe and create any diagram in a declarative fashion.

This approach has become so widely accepted that it has effectively replaced R's native diagrams and added several extensions, some of which we will mention here.

## [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)

**Leaflet** by Volodymyr Agafonkin is one of the most popular open-source JavaScript libraries for interactive maps, used by the New York Times and the Washington Post. Leaflet for R offers an easy way to integrate leaflet maps into R.

## [simplevis](https://statisticsnz.github.io/simplevis/)

With ggplot2- and leaflet, we have already introduced two practical tools. With simplevis, the aim is to facilitate visualization with less brainpower by providing a package of wrapper functions of these two packages.

## [GGANIMATE](https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html)

gganimate is an extension of ggplot, which makes it possible to create diagrams with beautiful animations in R.

The grammar principle is extended by a series of additional components that the data scientist can add to the ggplot object to represent how it should change over time.

## [ggvis](https://ggvis.rstudio.com/)

In keeping with the philosophy of **ggplot2** (and the grammar of the graphics), **ggvis** makes it possible to create interactive graphics that the user can test either in Rstudio or in the browser using the shiny infrastructure.

## [RGL](https://dmurdoch.github.io/rgl/)

Enables the creation of interactive 3D graphics in R based on **OpenGL** or **WebGL** in the backend.

## [rayrender](https://www.rayrender.net/)

Inspired by Peter Shirley's three books on ray tracing, this open-source R package allows you to do the same thing when creating 3D scenes in R.

## [highcharter](https://jkunst.com/highcharter/)

This R package provides a collection of wrapper functions around the JavaScript library of the same name in R. **Highcharts** (JavaScript) is already used as a flexible and customizable chart library by BBC, Sony, and Twitter.

## [Plotly](https://plotly.com/r/)

With Plotly, the focus is on interactive, publication-quality diagrams. You will find examples for creating line charts, scatter plots, area plots, etc.

## [Lattice](http://lattice.r-forge.r-project.org/)

With a focus on multivariate data, Lattice is a powerful and equally elegant high-level data visualization system inspired by Trellis graphics. While sufficient for typical graphing needs, Lattice is flexible enough to meet most non-standard requirements.
