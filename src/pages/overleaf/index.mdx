# Reference Manager for Overleaf with CiteDrive

At last, focus on authoring your paper instead of worrying about keeping your references and citations in sync. Thanks to the seamless integration between CiteDrive and Overleaf, you can now effortlessly add in-text citations to your paper without ever leaving your Overleaf project.

### In-text citations, made dead simple.

With the help of the CiteDrive Companion browser add-on, inserting in-text citations to your Overleaf paper is a snap. Simply place your cursor within the editor, click the “insert citation” button along the top of the screen, select the reference of interest and confirm.

### Collect references from anywhere

CiteDrive Companion improves life outside the editor as well by empowering you to quickly collect references where you find them. Whether you prefer to use PubMed, Google Scholar or other resources for discovering references, you can quickly generate, customize and add BibTeX entries to your project and immediately make them available for citation in your Overleaf paper.

### Natively Bib[La]TeX - not an afterthought.

Most reference managers with BibTeX / BibLaTeX support do so as a conversion or translation and you lose out on much of the benefit and rich control offered by handcrafting your references. Because CiteDrive is built natively for Bib[La]TeX, you maintain full control and can leverage custom fields as you please. You shouldn’t be forced to choose between ease and utility.

### Collaborative, just like Overleaf

We believe collaborative writing and collaborative reference management go hand-in-hand. Add collaborators to your CiteDrive project just as you would with your Overleaf paper so collecting references can be a team effort.

At last, focus on authoring your paper instead of worrying about keeping your references and citations in sync. Thanks to the seamless integration between CiteDrive and Overleaf, you can now effortlessly add in-text citations to your paper without ever leaving your Overleaf project.

## About Overleaf

Overleaf empowers teams of students and researchers to collaboratively write papers from anywhere in an easy-to-use, online LaTeX editor. With the addition of one of many available packages– such as BibTeX– Overleaf can also automatically generate in-text citations and bibliographies based on reference keys pulled from a flat BibTeX database file. When combined with CiteDrive and the CiteDrive Companion browser add-on, manually maintaining your BibTeX database as well as the guesswork of writing in-text citation snippets becomes a thing of the past. Focus on the work at hand and Cite The Way You Write.

## About CiteDrive

CiteDrive was born out of a common refrain among our team, friends, and fellow academics that managing references felt so clunky compared with today’s consumer-grade tools and collaborative editors. Worse yet, there weren’t really any good solutions that were truly built to serve those authoring LaTeX instead of it merely being an afterthought.

After a couple of initial failed experiments, the first end-to-end experience focusing on Overleaf users was piloted in fall 2021 and quickly evolved into the platform as it exists today.

CiteDrive continues to relentlessly focus on refining and simplifying the experience of discovering references and citing as you write. After a couple of initial failed experiments, the first end-to-end experience focusing on Overleaf users was piloted in fall 2021 and quickly evolved into the platform as it exists today.
